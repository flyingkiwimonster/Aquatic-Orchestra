# Aquatic-Orchestra
This is a project developed for the Toolkit module as part of my MSc in Creative Technology.

This interactive installation will observe fish in the Bristol aquarium and generate sounds according to their colour and movements.

The objective of this installation is to explore the notion of aquatic animals producing music, using a camera to observe and track their movements and body colour. 
There will also be an interactable device present (tablet or a laptop) displaying the area in the field of view of the camera, where the members of the audience will be able to interact with the installation by selecting a fish to isolate its sound. 
The installation is specifically designed to be located in the Bristol Aquarium.
